## Introduction :

Social Media is a HMS Application which allow users to connect with friends, work colleagues or people they don’t know, online. It allows users to share pictures and videos, with however many people they like. Users send “friend requests” to people who they may – or may not – know. Once accepted, the two profiles are connected with both users able to see whatever the other person posts. “Social Media” can post almost anything to their timeline. App is developed using below HMS Features.
